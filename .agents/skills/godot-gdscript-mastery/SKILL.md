# GDScript Mastery

Expert guidance for writing performant, maintainable GDScript — Godot-landmine decision trees, not a style-guide reprint.

## Do NOT Load

- Do **not** load this skill for general prose style or Godot engine version upgrades (3→4 / 4.x hops) — those live in [godot-version-migration](https://github.com/thedivergentai/gd-agentic-skills/blob/main/skills/godot-version-migration/SKILL.md) (plus official upgrading guides via that hub).
- Do **not** preload every script below; open only the MANDATORY pointer for the Core Directive you are implementing.
- Do **not** treat EditorScript utilities (`type_checker`, `performance_analyzer`, `signal_architecture_validator`) as runtime gameplay code.

## NEVER Do in GDScript

- **NEVER use `@onready` and `@export` on the same variable** — Initialization order will cause `@onready` to overwrite the Inspector value.
- **NEVER modify a Dictionary's size while iterating it** — Use `dict.keys().duplicate()` or iterate a clone to safely erase elements.
- **NEVER use string-based `connect("signal", ...)`** — Always use the Signal object syntax (`button.pressed.connect(...)`) for compile-time safety.
- **NEVER attempt to override non-virtual native engine methods** — Overriding `queue_free()` or `get_class()` is unsupported and will be ignored by engine callbacks.
- **NEVER use dynamic `get_node()` or `$` inside `_process()`** — Fetching paths every frame stalls the CPU. Cache and use `@onready`.
- **NEVER use `Parent.method()` calls** — Violates "Signal Up, Call Down". Use signals to communicate with parents.
- **NEVER use `is` followed by a hard cast** — If the type check passes but the object changes, it crashes. Use `as` and check for null.
- **NEVER use `print()` for production debugging** — Use `push_error()`, `push_warning()`, or breakpoints.
- **NEVER pre-load huge resources in `_ready()`** — Use `ResourceLoader.load_threaded_request()` for async loading.
- **NEVER use global variables in Autoloads when `static var` is sufficient** — Static variables offer better encapsulation.

## Core Directives (decision trees + MANDATORY scripts)

### 1. Strong Typing & Performance
| Landmine | Decision |
|---|---|
| Hot path still `Variant`? | Annotate vars/returns; prefer typed collections |
| Generic math in `_process`? | Use typed helpers (`absf`, `ceili`, `clampf`) |
| Green safe-lines missing? | Fix inference with `:=` or explicit types |

> **MANDATORY**: [typed_collections_mastery.gd](scripts/typed_collections_mastery.gd), [array_preallocation_perf.gd](scripts/array_preallocation_perf.gd), [type_checker.gd](scripts/type_checker.gd) (EditorScript audit).

### 2. Signal Architecture
| Landmine | Decision |
|---|---|
| Child needs parent reaction? | Emit signal up — never call parent methods |
| Cross-script payload unsafe? | Typed `signal name(arg: Type)` |
| Connect visibility? | Prefer `_ready()` connects over invisible editor-only wiring |

> **MANDATORY**: [typed_signal_definitions.gd](scripts/typed_signal_definitions.gd), [signal_architecture_validator.gd](scripts/signal_architecture_validator.gd).

### 3. Node Access & Lifecycle Safety
| Landmine | Decision |
|---|---|
| Need child nodes? | `@onready` / `%UniqueName` — never in `_init()` |
| Scene-instanced node with ctor args? | Use `@export` injection — `_init(args)` breaks `PackedScene.instantiate()` |
| Path lookup every frame? | Cache once; never `$` / `get_node` in `_process` |

> **MANDATORY**: [safe_type_casting.gd](scripts/safe_type_casting.gd).

### 4. Callable & Signal (First-Class)
| Landmine | Decision |
|---|---|
| Extra context on callback? | `Callable.bind(...)` |
| Discard unused signal args? | `Callable.unbind(n)` |
| One-off timeout logic? | Inline lambda OK; keep refs if `create_callback`-style longevity matters |

> **MANDATORY**: [callable_binding_context.gd](scripts/callable_binding_context.gd), [unbind_signal_args.gd](scripts/unbind_signal_args.gd), [advanced_lambdas.gd](scripts/advanced_lambdas.gd), [functional_lambda_logic.gd](scripts/functional_lambda_logic.gd).

### 5. Async, Statics & Safe Collections
| Landmine | Decision |
|---|---|
| Sequence timers without threads? | `await` chains — see await manager |
| Global state without Autoload bloat? | `static var` (+ nullify large statics when done) |
| Erase while iterating Dictionary? | Clone keys first |

> **MANDATORY**: [await_sequence_manager.gd](scripts/await_sequence_manager.gd), [static_var_singleton_alt.gd](scripts/static_var_singleton_alt.gd), [dictionary_safe_iteration.gd](scripts/dictionary_safe_iteration.gd), [performance_analyzer.gd](scripts/performance_analyzer.gd) (EditorScript).

## Quick Landmines

- Prefer `dict.get("key", default)` over `dict["key"]` when presence is uncertain.
- Toggle **Access as Scene Unique Name** and read via `%Name` for critical UI/nodes.
- Script layout order: `extends` → `class_name` → signals/enums/consts → exports/onready → lifecycle → public → `_private`.

## Expert knowledge (on demand)

> **LLM-ignorance rule:** If a general agent would not know it before reading, load the reference — never delete expert deltas.

- [gdscript-core-directives.md](references/gdscript-core-directives.md) — restored baseline pedagogy (architecture, WHY, implementation depth)
