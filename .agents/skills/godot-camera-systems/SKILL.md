## NEVER Do

- **NEVER use `global_position = target.global_position` every frame** — Instant position matching causes jittery movement. Use `lerp()` or `position_smoothing_enabled = true`.
- **NEVER use `offset` for permanent camera positioning** — `offset` is for shake, sway, or temporary recoil effects only. Use `position` for permanent framing.
- **NEVER forget `limit_smoothed = true` for `Camera2D`** — Hard boundaries cause jarring visual stops.
- **NEVER enable multiple `Camera2D` nodes in the same viewport simultaneously** — Only the last enabled camera takes precedence. Explicitly disable inactive cameras.
- **NEVER use `SpringArm3D` without a collision mask** — It will clip through terrain and walls. Set it to the world/environment layer.
- **NEVER implement screen shake by randomizing `position` (or `randf` on `offset` as the whole system)** — Use a dedicated Trauma/Noise system layered on follow ([camera_shake_trauma_pro.gd](scripts/camera_shake_trauma_pro.gd)).
- **NEVER parent the Camera directly to a high-speed physics body as the default rig** — Physics stutter or parent rotation causes motion sickness. Prefer `RemoteTransform2D/3D` / phantom decoupling with rotation sync disabled ([remote_transform_decoupling.gd](scripts/remote_transform_decoupling.gd), [phantom_decoupling.gd](scripts/phantom_decoupling.gd)).
- **NEVER use `look_at()` in 3D without a fallback for the 'Up' vector** — Targets directly above/below flip the camera; use guards or Quaternion math.
- **NEVER rely on `SubViewport` defaults for Mini-maps** — Set `render_target_update_mode` to `UPDATE_WHEN_VISIBLE` or a lower fixed rate.
- **NEVER use linear interpolation for Zoom** — Prefer exponential lerp or Tween `TRANS_CUBIC`.

## Parenting / Decoupling (resolved)

| Rig | When | Script |
|-----|------|--------|
| **Default:** RemoteTransform / phantom | Player is CharacterBody / high-speed / rotates | [remote_transform_decoupling.gd](scripts/remote_transform_decoupling.gd), [phantom_decoupling.gd](scripts/phantom_decoupling.gd) |
| Camera as child of player | Slow top-down / locked rotation / prototype only | Explicit caveat: disable if motion sickness or physics jitter appears; never combine with position-overwrite shake |
| SpringArm3D + Camera3D | Third-person occlusion | [spring_lerp_camera_3d.gd](scripts/spring_lerp_camera_3d.gd) — mask required |

## Expert Camera Architectures

### 1. Multi-target framing
Compute AABB of targets → lerp camera to center → zoom/distance to fit with margin. Keep juice shake on `offset` only. **MANDATORY:** [framing_box_camera_2d.gd](scripts/framing_box_camera_2d.gd).

### 2. Occlusion (3D)
Prefer `SpringArm3D` with world collision mask; custom rigs use `intersect_ray` between ideal camera pos and target — [occlusion_aware_camera_3d.gd](scripts/occlusion_aware_camera_3d.gd) (peer `godot-raycasting-queries`).

### 3. Trauma audit
Plot trauma decay (debug draw) while tuning [camera_shake_trauma_pro.gd](scripts/camera_shake_trauma_pro.gd) — wire [trauma_debugger.gd](scripts/trauma_debugger.gd) to `get_trauma()`. Never validate feel with raw `randf` offset demos.

> **MANDATORY** for multi-target framing, custom occlusion rigs, 2D/3D follow recipes, and cinematic transitions: [camera-expert-patterns.md](references/camera-expert-patterns.md). **Do NOT Load** when golden-path scripts already cover your rig.
